Hi, I'm John and I am a Computer Science student at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) majoring in Software Engineering, expecting a Bachelor's degree in December 2026.
I am currently a Radiologic Technologist taking x-rays in the medical field, though I am looking for a career change to challenge myself in the ever-evolving field of technology.
I enjoy working out, gaming, and playing music when I am not at my computer. I also love to do outdoor activities such as hiking, rock climbing, and snowboarding when I get the chance!
